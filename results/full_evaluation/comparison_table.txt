FACE VERIFICATION EVALUATION - ABLATION STUDY RESULTS
================================================================================

Comparing 4 configurations on LFW low-light face verification task
Dataset: LFW synthetic low-light images
Pairs: Genuine (same person) + Impostor (different people)
Evaluation Protocol: Standard face verification with EER, TAR@FAR metrics

METRIC DEFINITIONS:
  • Genuine Similarity: Face similarity for same person (HIGHER is better)
  • Impostor Similarity: Face similarity for different people (LOWER is better)
  • EER: Equal Error Rate where FRR=FAR (LOWER is better)
  • TAR@FAR: True Accept Rate at False Accept Rate threshold (HIGHER is better)
  • PSNR: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio in dB (HIGHER is better)
  • SSIM: Structural Similarity Index (HIGHER is better, max=1.0)

NOTE: All metrics computed on enhanced images compared to ground truth.
      For genuine pairs, low-light and enhanced images are compared to GT.
      For impostor pairs, different identities are compared.
